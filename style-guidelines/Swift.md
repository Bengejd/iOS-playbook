# Hyper's Swift Style Guide

Our overarching goals are conciseness, readability, and simplicity. 

When we write Swift code we follow [The Official raywenderlich.com Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide) and [The Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).
